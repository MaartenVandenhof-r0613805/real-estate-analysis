# TL;DR
This project tries to analyse the real estate market in the Flanders region of Belgium using real estate data from [statebel.be](www.statbel.be).
First it visualises the data found [here](https://real-estate-analysis-flanders.herokuapp.com) and afterwards it tries to simulate the price increases for each quartile using different ML techniques [here](https://real-estate-fl-ml.herokuapp.com).
