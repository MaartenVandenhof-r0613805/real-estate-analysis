# TL;DR
This project tries to analyse the real estate market in the Flanders region of Belgium using real estate data from [statebel](https://statbel.fgov.be/en/themes/housing).
First it visualizes the data found [here](https://real-estate-analysis-flanders.herokuapp.com) and afterwards it tries to simulate the price increases for each quartile using different ML techniques [here](https://real-estate-fl-ml.herokuapp.com).
