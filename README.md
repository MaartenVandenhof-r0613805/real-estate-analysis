# TL;DR
This project tries to analyse the real estate market in the Flanders region of Belgium using combined real estate datasets from [statebel](https://statbel.fgov.be/en/themes/housing) and [OECD](https://data.oecd.org/interest/long-term-interest-rates.htm) long term interests data.
First it visualizes the data found [here](https://real-estate-analysis-flanders.herokuapp.com) and afterwards it tries to simulate the price increases for each quartile using different ML techniques [here](https://real-estate-fl-ml.herokuapp.com).
